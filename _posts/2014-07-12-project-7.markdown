description: During Making Games I worked on a prototype with 2 designers where we had to make something simple in Twine. We made The Purple Club which we uploaded on itch.io at this link - <a class="altstyle" href="https://ghostyjam.itch.io/the-purple-club">The Purple Club</a>. I worked on the implementation of the paths, the maze and countdown mechanic and implementation of music.
