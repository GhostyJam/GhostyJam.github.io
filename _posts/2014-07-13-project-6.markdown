description: For the course Data-Driven Design and Development I worked in a group where we implemented an A/B test on the game Slimekeeper by BenBonk while using eye-tracking as a way to measure competitiveness. During the project I mainly worked on our modified version of Slimekeep, helping understand the eye-tracking software, and running the experiments.
