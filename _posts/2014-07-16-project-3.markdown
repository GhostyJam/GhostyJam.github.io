description: For my bachelor project I set out to explore roguelikes, frustration, player experience, and physiologi. I made use of the popular roguelike <a class="altstyle" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">Hades</a> by Supergiant Games, the Polar H10 ECG sensor, and various questionnaires to try and piece together how players react and feel while playing roguelikes. I was lucky to have a really amazing supervisor who believed in me and the project which lead to it ultimately getting published for the Advances in Computer Games conference in 2023 under the name <a class="altstyle" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-54968-7_10">Hades Again and Again A Study on Frustration Tolerence, Physiology and Player Experience</a>. The data associated with the study can be found <a class="altstyle" href="https://github.com/itubrainlab/hades_player_experience">here</a>, and a video of PhD student Laurits talking about my research can be seen <a class="altstyle" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cl-L2UalQQ&t=1326s">here</a>.
