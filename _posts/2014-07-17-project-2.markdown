description: 3 Days is a critical game made for Playable Media. We had to make a project inspired by critical design, I chose to make a game criticising the DEI bans which have been rolled out by the American Administration since January 2025. I made the prototype completely on my own, except for the dialogue mechanic. The prototype can be played at: https://ghostyjam.itch.io/3-days
