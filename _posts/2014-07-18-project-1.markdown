description: The Bridge to Yesterday started out as a course project for Making Games. In January 2024 the game was showcased at Copenhagen Gaming Week, and won the student showcase, earning us tickets to Nordic Game Conference in Malm√∂ in May 2024, where we got to display our game along many amazing professionally made games. I worked as a game programmer on this project, working mainly on movement, camera, and puzzle mechanics.
